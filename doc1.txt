Cooking acids tend to be mellow, transforming the foods with which they are cooked slowly, over time.
They can be extraordinarily subtle; while their presence may go undetected, their absence is sharply felt.
I learned this painful lesson when at the request of a distant relative, I tried to make beef bourguignon without the Bourgogne in Iran,
where wine isn’t readily available. No matter what I did, I couldn’t get the dish to taste right without that crucial ingredient.

Give acid the time it needs to do its silent work when macerating shallots and onions.
Macerate, from Latin, “to soften,” refers to the process whereby ingredients soak in some form of acid — 
usually vinegar or citrus juice—to soften their harshness. Simply coat the shallots or onions in acid—they don’t need to be completely submerged.
If you plan on using a couple of tablespoons of vinegar for a dressing, just coat the shallots with it first, 
and wait 15 or 20 minutes before adding oil to build the dressing in the same cup or bowl. It will be enough to prevent dragon breath.

There’s no replacement for working acid early into braises and stews; the remarkable alchemy of time and heat will soften any dish’s sharp edges.
Omit the tomatoes and beer from Pork Braised with Chillies and the sweetness of the aromatic base of onions and garlic will dominate.
The sweetness resulting from browning needs the foil of acid, too. 
Deglazing a pan with wine, whether for risotto, pork chops, fish fillets, or a more complex reduction sauce will keep a dish from skewing too sweet.
